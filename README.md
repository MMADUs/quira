## About Quira

Quira is a quantum computing package that transcends conventional bit-based computation. Its architecture is predicated on the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, where in computational states exist as complex probability amplitudes within a multidimensional Hilbert space. The framework harnesses the intrinsic parallelism of quantum superposition, enabling the simultaneous exploration of exponentially many computational paths through precisely orchestrated unitary transformations.
